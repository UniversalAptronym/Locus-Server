# New File/Folder Instructions for Windows.

Before you begin, you should make a dedicated folder for information about your server on your computer. 

To make a new folder on Windows, navigate to your desktop or open File Explorer and navigate to the location you want your server information to be stored. **Right-click** on your desktop or in File Explorer, select **New Folder**, then type your desired folder name and press Enter. 

Open this folder. Within this folder, create three new plaintext files (plaintext files have the file extension **.txt**). Do this by **right-clicking**, clicking **New Text Document**, then typing `Cloudflare_Tunnel` and pressing Enter. This will save an empty text file named `Cloudflare_Tunnel.txt`. Repeat this to create files named `Cloudlflare_SSL_Certificate` and `Cloudlflare_SSL_Private_Key` as well.
