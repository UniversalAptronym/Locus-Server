To-do:
- Instructions of how to put Pis together, with pictures. 
- - Include pictures of it plugged in. 

**Caution:** The Raspberry Pi is a temperature sensitive device! Their internal circuitry heats up while in use and while they are durable, you don't want to overheat them unnecessarily. When in operation it is recommended you keep your Pi in a shaded location with good airflow and away from sources of heat. If you live in a hot climate, pay attention to the temperature monitor (see below, which will be discussed later in the guide). If your Pi is regularly running at over 45 C, move it to a cooler location and/or follow this link for [Raspberry Pi cooling advice](../Instructions/Getting_The_Most_Out_Of_Your_Pi.md).
